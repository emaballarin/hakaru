#      is the same as
#   DOMAIN(        ..               , DInto(x,xt,DInto(y,yt,DConstrain(..))) )
# basically, when we see an 'unbound' variable in the 'RHS' , we should bind
# it with the default 'DInto'.

  # Validates input and calls `do_apply' which implements the main logic.  This
  # function returns a function which takes as input the program corresponding
  # to the 'body' (i.e. what is left after extracting the domain bounds and
  # shape) and produces a program equivalent to the original (i.e. what was
  # present before extracting domain bounds and shape), but simplified. In
  # equational language:
  #   let (b,e1) = Extract:-Bound(e0)
  #       (s,e2) = Extract:-Shape(e1)
  #       e3     = Apply(DOMAIN(s,b))(e2)

  # is an invariant of Domain.
  #
  # `Apply' also takes an additional argument, which is a record which should
  # contain handlers which determine how Domain constructors are applied to the
  # resulting expression, and a table of weights which appear outermost to each
  # domain bound variable. Some of these may have defaults (see *** below).
  #
  # The weights table is a mapping from variables appearing in the domain bounds
  # to weights which appear immediately outside the application of that domain
  # bound. It is passed to certain callbacks which can chose where to place said
  # weights.
  #
  # Each handler loosely corresponds to a Domain constructor, except for
  # `f_body'.
  # f_into : DomBoundKind -> LO x -> DomBoundVar -> DomBoundRange -> KB
  #        -> WeightsTable -> LO x
  #   The 1st, 3rd, and 4th arguments come directly from a DomInto;
  #   the 2nd argument is the recursive application of Apply;
  #   the 5th and 6th arguments come from the context
  # f_sum  : Sequence (LO x) -> LO x
  #   Sequence being a Maple sequence (i.e. `f_sum' is an n-ary function)
  # f_constrain : (forall x . LO x -> LO x) -> LO x -> LO x
  #   The 1st argument places a constraint on a LO, the 2nd arguement is the
  #   expression to be constrained.
  # f_body : LO x -> KB -> LO x
  #   This handler is called on the 'body', along with the context in which that
  #   'body' expression exists. This may be called multiple times, if for
  #   example the domain contains `DSum' or `DSplit'.
